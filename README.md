# Assessing Climate Change Perceptions and Behaviours in Historical Newspapers (Gazette de Lausanne)

## OVERVIEW

With emissions in line with current Paris Agreement commitments, global warming is projected to exceed 1.5 °C above pre-industrial levels, even if these commitments are complemented by very difficult increases in magnitude and intensity and ambition of mitigation after 2030. Despite this slight increase, the consequences of global warming are already observable today, with the number and intensity of certain natural hazards continuing to increase (e.g., extreme weather events, floods, forest fires). Near-term warming and increased frequency, severity, and duration of extreme events will place many terrestrial, freshwater, coastal and marine ecosystems at high or very high risks of biodiversity loss. Exploring historical documents can help to address gaps in our understanding of the historical roots of climate change, and possibly uncover evidence of early efforts to address environmental issues, as well as explore how environmentalism has evolved over time. This project aims to fill gaps in our understanding by examining a corpus of historical Swiss and Luxembourgish newspapers spanning 200 years (i.e., the impresso project’s corpus).

This work explores several NLP techniques (text classification, information extraction, etc.) for providing a comprehensive understanding of the evolution and reporting of extreme weather events in historical documents.

## GOALS

- How have perceptions of climate change evolved over time, as seen in historical newspapers?
- What behavioural trends towards climate change can be identified from historical newspapers?
- Can we track the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events over time based on historical documents?
- Can we identify any patterns or trends in early efforts to address environmental issues?
